I am a technology professional, but I don't consider myself a digital native. I grew up spending tons of time outside and reading books—made of paper. We did have a TV and a computer, but I had essentially no access to the internet until high school, and I had one foot out the door on the way to college by the time I bought my first cell phone.

## Early exposure to tech

As a kid, using the computer was a big part of how I learned how to read. My family's 80286 "IBM compatible" computer didn't have a graphical interface (like Windows or macOS), and I had a purple spiral-bound notebook where I would keep notes on what MS-DOS commands to use to get me to whatever game I wanted to play. Most of the games also required entering text-based commands and reading responses, and those games contributed greatly to my written vocabulary. (A lot of those great games are playable online now—check out details and links [here]({% post_url 2024-01-22-classic-games %}).)

Growing up I definitely had a knack for fiddling with computers. The first operating system I installed was Windows 3.0, on the 486 PC that later replaced the 286. I can't quite remember my first exposure to software code, but I certainly used [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) and [Integer BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC) on the Apple ][ computers at school, and of course I wrote or edited the occasional [MS-DOS batch file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) at home.

I was comfortable in [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) while still fairly young, and in high school I took courses in [Visual Basic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)>) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), eventually writing a full-fledged business application for my school using VB and [MS SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server).

## Competing interests

Meanwhile—and completely separately—I developed a strong interest in the international community and cross-cultural relations. My family hosted two international exchange students, for a year each, and for a couple years I was the president of a large high school student group focused on multiculturalism. I was also keenly focused on developing leadership skills as I worked my way toward becoming an Eagle Scout.

Late in my junior year, I was shocked to learn that my high school's faculty had chosen me to attend [Boys State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys/Girls_State), the summer leadership and civics program sponsored by the American Legion. I was no dummy, but I was certainly not a straight-A student, and I figured the faculty primarily knew me as the guy who wrote the software that tracked students' whereabouts when they were in the library instead of their assigned study halls. The school was massive; for hundreds of faculty members to vote to give me one of the two available seats was an incredible honor—and incredibly unexpected. It was also quite the wake-up call that I should be investigating careers other than technology and business as I planned my future.

Through connections I made at Boys State, I became involved in an elaborate statewide effort to dramatically increase youth voter turnout in New Hampshire's 2000 first-in-the-nation presidential primary. We organized voter registration drives at high schools across the state, and we organized a youth-focused presidential candidate forum in collaboration with [MTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV), [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central) and [Rock the Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_the_Vote).

By that time, it was clear to me that I would not be studying computer science or business after graduation. I sat down with the faculty member who had been my independent study advisor, both to let him know that I would be going in a different direction and to apologize for the time he had spent mentoring me, only for me to choose a different direction. To my surprise, he told me that he had been the one to nominate me to go to Boys State in the first place. He had seen all along that programming wasn't a perfect fit, another very strong signal that I was doing the right thing.

## Learning to fly

_(an interlude)_

Skipping back a few years, starting when I was in the 5th grade I learned the basics of how to fly an airplane. A flight instructor who lived nearby volunteered that year to run weekly introductory aviation classes for a few of us in my school's gifted and talented program. Over the first year or so, we worked on applied aerodynamics—how the shape of an aircraft influences how it flies, etc. In the process, we built and launched a lot of paper airplanes and at least a few model rockets. We spent the following year studying for the private pilot written exam, and we took the exam at the end of the year. In the third year we took advantage of the fact that this program was backed by FAA's regional education office, which gave us the ability to visit air traffic control towers and radar facilities. We also began spending time in the cockpit, piloting a Cessna 172 witn our instructor in the other seat.

Unfortunately, funding began to dry up just as interest was waning among program participants. The added distractions of high school life were too much competition for alreadyh limited opportunities to get to the airport and get in an airplane, and the program ended.

Learning to fly—at least a little bit—taught me valuable lessons that have parallels outside the aviation space. If something goes wrong, your top priorities are—in order—to _aviate_ (keep the aircraft in the air and operating stably), _navigate_ (figure out where you are and what direction you are headed) and _communicate_ (let ATC, nearby pilots and others onboard know what is happening and what you need). Stabilize the situation to the extent that things aren't worsening by the second, figure out where you'll end up if you take no further action, then reach out for help to determine the best way forward. Everything else can wait.
